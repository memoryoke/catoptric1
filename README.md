# catoptric1
A real-time catoptric video processor. It uses photometric luma-sampling to dynamically tessellate a webcam feed into a grid of micro-kaleidoscopes. By isolating a single quadrant per cell and applying horizontal/vertical mirrors, it generates complex geometric patterns while preserving pixel-perfect edge aliasing.
